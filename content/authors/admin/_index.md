I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in geodesy and survey engineering, in Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. I received the B.Eng.üéì and M.Eng.üéì degrees in geodesy and survey engineering in 2019 and 2022, respectively.
My current research interests include Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) precise positioning, state estimation for robotics, resilient integration and online calibration of multi-sensors, and synergy of redundant homogeneous sensors.
